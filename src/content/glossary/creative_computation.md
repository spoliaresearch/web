Creative, adjective

1. Relating to or involving the use of imagination or original ideas
2. Having the ability to create

Computation, noun

1. The process of calculating or processing information
2. The use of computers to process data or perform operations

## Understanding Creative Computation

Creative computation explores computers as expressive mediums rather than just tools for solving problems. John Maeda's "Design By Numbers" (1999) established how programming could serve artistic exploration, treating code as a creative material with its own properties and possibilities.

## Theoretical Framework

Seymour Papert's constructionist learning theory provides foundation for creative computation, showing how building with code enables new forms of thinking and expression. This connects to Alan Kay's vision of the computer as a "metamedium" capable of simulating all other media while creating entirely new forms of expression.

## Contemporary Applications

Modern creative computation spans generative art, interactive installations, and computational design. Casey Reas and Ben Fry's Processing environment demonstrates how programming environments can be designed specifically for creative exploration, while projects like OpenAI's DALL-E show how computation can extend creative capabilities in unexpected ways.
