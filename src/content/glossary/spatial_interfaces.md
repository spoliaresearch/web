Spatial, adjective

1. Relating to space
2. Existing or occurring in physical space
3. Having extension in three dimensions

Interface, noun

1. A point of interaction between systems
2. The means by which interaction or communication is achieved

## Understanding Spatial Interfaces

Spatial interfaces move computing beyond flat screens into three-dimensional space, leveraging human spatial cognition and physical intuition. This approach builds on Ivan Sutherland's early work with Sketchpad and the Sword of Damocles, which first demonstrated how computing could extend into physical space.

## Theoretical Framework

Paul Dourish's "Where the Action Is" (2001) establishes how embodied interaction shapes our understanding of spatial computing. This work shows how physical movement, gesture, and environmental awareness create new possibilities for human-computer interaction. These ideas extend J.J. Gibson's ecological psychology, particularly his concepts of affordances and environmental perception.

## Contemporary Applications

Modern spatial interfaces appear in augmented reality, virtual environments, and ambient computing systems. They emphasize natural interaction through movement and gesture, while considering how digital information can be meaningfully embedded in physical space. This creates new challenges in mapping between physical and digital spatial relationships.
